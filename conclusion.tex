\paragraph{Future Work}\todo{Work this in} Hyper-parameter optimization techniques such as grid-search could be used to fine-tune the evolutionary and coarsening hyper-parameters. Encoding the coarsening parameters into the population will make the algorithm less sensitive to the initial settings with the added cost of increasing the dimension of the optimization task. Of interest is also comparison of different choices of genetic operators as well as a multi-criterial optimization with an additional criterion defined, e.g., as the reduction ratio of the input graph size.
