Graph based models are used for tasks with increasing size and computational demands. The paper focuses on leveraging methods for pretraining on coarser graphs with Hierarchical Representation Learning for Networks (HARP) as the method of choice. The method is generalized into a framework for graph coarsenings using partially injective homomorphisms, a concept from the field of data mining. Such a way of producing graph coarsenings is shown to be feasible and extensible. Building on that, this work introduces a new way of constructing graph coarsenings inspired by recent works in graph diffusion. Finally the graph coarsening framework is leveraged to enable learning of suitable coarsenings on a per-problem basis.
