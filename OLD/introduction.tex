\section{Introduction}

In the next section, the graph learning algorithm HARP is presented, followed by a section presenting partially injective homomorphisms. Section \ref{sec:harp-as-pihom} connects these ideas and Section \ref{sec:performance-vs-complexity} discusses the performance characteristics of HARP. Finally, Section \ref{sec:experiments} supports our theses with experimental evaluation.
