\section{Conclusion}

In our work in progress, a way to merge method generality, computational efficiency and high performance was explored. HARP and partially injective homomorphisms were presented and subsequently connected as a way to, in a future work, adapt graph coarsenings to a specific task. This connection was experimentally verified not to impact prediction performance. Furthermore, the effect of HARP pretraining on learning characteristics was studied and found to reduce the need for training on fine (and therefore large) graphs, making way for a more efficient training without sacrificing performance.
