\subsection{Embedding prolongation}
In each coarsening step, an embedding of the graph \( G_i \) is trained by one of the embedding algorithms. To continue training with a finer graph, this embedding \( \Phi_i: V \left( G_i \right) \to \mathfield{R}^d \) needs to be \textit{prolonged} to create the finer embedding \( \Phi_{i - 1}: V \left( G_{i - 1} \right) \to \mathfield{R}^d \). To achieve this, the representation of a node in the graph \( G_i \) is copied for each of the nodes in \( G_{i - 1} \) it was created from (by the graph collapsing algorithm). That is,
\[ \Phi_{i - 1} \left( u \right) = \Phi_i \left( \psi_i \left( u \right) \right)\text{.} \]
This is then taken as the starting point for the next training phase.
