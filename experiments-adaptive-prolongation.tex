\section{Experimental evaluation of the adaptive approach}
Show the results of the adaptive prolongation on multiple datasets, compare it to ordinary Node2vec and HARP.

Possibly include statistical significance testing.

\subsection{Relation to graph properties}
Compare the adaptive coarsening with local graph measures of graph homophilly
